# If Rules
# 1. Every If Statement must have an else. (I don't normally do this, but feel like it would help)
# 2. If the else seems like it wouldn't run, then raise an error or die, to show that fact
# 3. Never nest ifs more than 2 levels. If needed, write some functions
# 4. Treat if statements like paragraphs, leave space before and after.
# 5. The boolean expression should be simple, otherwise move it to a seperate line

# Loop Rules
# 1. Use while loops for infinite loops(or until broken)
# 2. Use for loops for everything else, so it's fixed

# Tips for debugging
# 1. Don't use a debugger, it's overkill. (I don't know if I agree with this, but I hope it means in simple cases)
# 2. The best way to debug a program is to use print (This seems a bit opinionated for a beginners, but i've always
#    been a fan of print debugging)
# 3. Run and Write your code incrementally rather than waiting till finished
