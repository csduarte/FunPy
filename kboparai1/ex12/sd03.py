# The pydoc module automatically generates documentation from Python modules. The documentation can be presented as
# pages of text on the console, served to a Web browser, or saved to HTML files.
#
# For modules, classes, functions and methods, the displayed documentation is derived from the docstring
# (i.e. the __doc__ attribute) of the object, and recursively of its documentable members.
# If there is no docstring, pydoc tries to obtain a description from the block of comment lines just above the
# definition of the class, function or method in the source file, or at the top of the module
# (see inspect.getcomments()).
#
# The built-in function help() invokes the online help system in the interactive interpreter, which uses pydoc to
# generate its documentation as text on the console. The same text documentation can also be viewed from outside the
# Python interpreter by running pydoc as a script at the operating systemâ€™s command prompt.
