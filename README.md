# FunPy
This project is all about working through Zed Shaw's Learn Python the Hard Way with a good friend. Feel free to submit the exercises yourself, so long as you follow the submission guidelines. I can't promise they will get reviewed, but I'll try!

## Submission Guidelines
1. Users' work should be in a folder named after that user. Ex: /csduarte/ex1/1.py
2. **All** exercises should be submitted, including the study drills at the end of each exercise
3. Each exercise should have an individual folder
4. If some drills seem stupid, do them anyway. Make an empty file with a comment, if needed.
5. Study Drills should be saved as a **separate** file, even if it creates duplicate code Ex: /csduarte/ex1/sd2.py
6. All deadlines are listed in the google calendar. You can work ahead, but you can't work behind.
7. Work should be submitted in the form of pull request. 
8. Reviews of pull request will suggest programatic/style changes that must be fixed the following day.
